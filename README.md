## Material and Mouse driven theme for [AwesomeWM 4.3](https://awesomewm.org/)
* Original work by ChrisTitusTech, which again was based off PapyElGringo work.

Note: This fork is an personal version of the work by ChrisTitusTech. (He has since released a newer design without the leftpanel which I didn't find as useful as the original). 

### Changed features

* removed gaps between windows
* made use of awesome-buttons library
* only 2 layouts used: tiled and maximised
* shadows behind windows and panels(using compton)
* used awesome-buttons with some modifications


An almost desktop environment made with [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) following the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io) with a performant opiniated mouse/keyboard workflow to increase daily productivity and comfort.

### 2) Clone the configuration

```
git clone https://github.com/bloc67/material-awesome.git ~/.config/awesome
```

### 3) Set the themes

Start `lxappearance` to active the **icon** theme and **GTK** theme
Note: for cursor theme, edit `~/.icons/default/index.theme` and `~/.config/gtk3-0/settings.ini`, for the change to also show up in applications run as root, copy the 2 files over to their respective place in `/root`.

### 4) Same theme for Qt/KDE applications and GTK applications, and fix missing indicators

First install `qt5-style-plugins` (debian) | `qt5-styleplugins` (arch) and add this to the bottom of your `/etc/environment`

```bash
XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Unity
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2
```

The first variable fixes most indicators (especially electron based ones!), the second tells Qt and KDE applications to use your gtk2 theme set through lxappearance.

### 5) Read the documentation

The documentation live within the source code.

The project is split in functional directories and in each of them there is a readme where you can get additional information about the them.
