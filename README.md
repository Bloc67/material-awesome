## Material and Mouse driven theme for [AwesomeWM 4.3](https://awesomewm.org/)
### Original work by PapyElGringo, official development seem to have moved to [material-shell](https://github.com/PapyElGringo/material-shell)

# Project has been moved to <https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/titus-awesome>

This was done because of various theme changes and creating a more minimal interface. This project will remain here for historical purposes and will no longer be maintained. 

The new Project also has two branches for Arch and Debian users to help more Linux users adopt this form of Tiling Window Management.
